fitness app


Picture this: you're at the gym with a screenshot of a workout you found. You're trying to use your phone's timer to keep track of each 
move, and switching to another app/screenshot to find the next move.

Sounds a bit frustrating right?

With FitStack, you can plug your favorite (or your original) workout routines in the order that you want, set the amount of reps or seconds
per move, and hit play! As soon as the timer for a certain move is done, the app will display the next move in the queue and keep things
moving. If you want to skip to the next move, just tap the screen.
